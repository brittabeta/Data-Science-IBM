# ~~My Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio~~
# A World of Possibilities

**Britta Smith**

Desired Occupation: Data Analyst/Scientist

**Why Data Science?**

*It all began with finding numbers and calculations captivating, and over time the power within these symbols transformed into a fascination. The process of uncovering meaning in data continually stirs my curiosity; it moves me to further unearth that which is hidden in the details.  The field of data science and analysis provides the opportunity to combine my natural inclination with helping others make more impactful, educated decisions.* 

### use print() to greet data:


```python
print('Hello world of data!')
```

    Hello world of data!

Economist Steve Levitt and his center at the University of Chicago asked 913 visitors of the Freakonomics website about work use of mathematics.  YouCubed, a research institute of Stanford University's Graduate School of Education surveyed 427 education leaders from the Curriculum and Instruction Steering Committee (CISC).

Survey respondents did not report much use of their traditional mathematics education; however, they were aware of their data use. 

| Mathematics or Data Use | Freakonomics Respondents | CISC Respondents |
|---|---|---|
| Algebra | 11% Daily/23% Never | 4% Daily/41% Never |
| Geometry | 4% Daily/50% Never | 0% Daily/59% Never |
| Trigonometry | 2% Daily/70% Never | 0% Daily/71% Never |
| Calculus | 2% Daily/79% Never | 1% Daily/82% Never |
| Visual Data | 23% Daily/8% Never | 12% Daily/1% Never |
| Analyze/Interpret Data | 31% Daily/11% Never | 21% Daily/3% Never |
| Spreadsheet Use | 66% Daily/3% Never | 56% Daily/2% Never |
| Access/Use Databases | 42% Daily/10% Never | 37% Daily/7% Never |

> Data awareness and data literacy are needed to not only be an effective employee but also function in the modern world. *YouCubed co-founder Professor Jo Boaler*

[YouCubed](https://www.youcubed.org/) and [Stanford University](https://ed.stanford.edu/news/bringing-math-class-data) are responding to the modern world data landscape by studying the incorporation of data into mathematics curriculum.  YouCubed provides resources to parents and teachers to inspire the movement of research findings into an increase in data literacy.  Among their many resources are “Data Talks” where learners are provided with data visualizations along with the questions, “What do you notice? What do you wonder? What is going on in this data visualization?” Two examples: [Handwashing](https://www.youcubed.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/HandWashing.pdf) and [Housing/Education/Wages](https://www.youcubed.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Housing-Education-Wages-Data-Talk.pdf).

While YouCubed does not currently provide resources concerning programming languages, many organizations such as [Code.org](https://code.org/) are working to expand K-12 computer science curriculum.  By 2018 the total number of Code.org learning platform accounts reached 1 million teachers and 36 million students.

Expansion of data literacy and computer science learning is great news, as there is a growing need for curious and competent data analysts, scientists, and engineers.
